# Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare by predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key physiological parameters. A Logistic Regression model is trained using structured health data such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose level. The project highlights the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
